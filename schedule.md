This schedule was written retroactively, began on Thurs. 9/29:

Spent most of the first week familiarizing myself with Ruby/Rails, using both video playlists that the instructors had uploaded, and several other video playlists I found on my own to further understand the concepts. Unlike other projects, I did not have many repetitions utilizing the language and framework to create projects, a lot of this was learning on the fly.

9/26 - Initialized repo, began Rails project. Began as a CRUD app with the intent of learning RoR. Started out as Friends List

9/27 - Used devise to properly set up login authentication. Long holdup as Devise created an email field for the User table, which my original Friends table also had. Resolved issues with deleting items. Hosted on Heroku. Came to terms with the fact Friends List is not the route I want to go, insert a bit of passion into the project w/ listing Original Records + Current Samples. Decided to go with Bootstrap Cards on the show pages.

9/28 - Resolved issues with signing out, due to devise (had to add something in routes.rb). Figured out how to properly insert iframes so that the Youtube videos began and ended at specific times. Pivotal for the project. Switched database from sqlite3 to Postgresql. Figured out Ransack, implemented both search and sort. Really figured out the table, looks clean and got it the way I want it.

9/29 - Decided on a name, and variables. Successfully renamed all variables, controllers, models, views, tests, helpers, from Friends variables to Dustloop ones

A little bit of styling was done on each day.
